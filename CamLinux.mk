# independently from its code, so we need to find where the resource
# class source got placed in the course of building the resources.
# Thus, the magic here.
# Also, this module cannot depend directly on the R.java file; if it
# did, the PRIVATE_* vars for R.java wouldn't be guaranteed to be correct.
# Instead, it depends on the R.stamp file, which lists the corresponding
# R.java file as a prerequisite.
# TODO: find a more appropriate way to do this.
