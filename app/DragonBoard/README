1. it can automaticly recognize V3(with UVC) or A20(with UVC or TVIN), so there's no need for you to configure UVC or TVIN on platform A20-machine

2. HOW TO CONFIGURE THE TESTER?
   if you want to test other device, such as KEY, TF, SPK(speaker), mic, rtc, acc(g-sensor), for example, you want to display TF-card tester and cancel RTC display on LCD
   there's TWO ways to configure:
   method 1: write "dragonboard.cfg" and put the FILE in TF-card by path of "DragonBoard/dragonboard.cfg".
             After you read "dragonboard.cfg" in DIR of "inc", you will know how to write "dragonboard.cfg", I have write it with the easiest way.
             Make sure the TF card is in plugged-in status when the machine powers on, because the program will read "dragonboard.cfg" to decide which device to test.
             If FILE "dragonboard.cfg" doesn't exist in TF-card when machine powers on, the program open all the tester by default!!!
   method 2: do NOT do the method 1, open file "core/dragonboard.cpp" and set or reset global variables "testKey", "testTf", "testRtc" and so on.
             for example, if you want to test "rtc" and do NOT want to test "acc", you set it with: "int testRtc = 1; int testAcc = 0;", the vars testRtcPath[40] and testAccPath[40] you don't care for it.

3. if you want to compile dragonboard of V3, there must be a file "testcase/wifitester/CamdLinux.mk"
   if you want to compile dragonboard of A20, you need rename the file "test...mk" to other name or delete it.
