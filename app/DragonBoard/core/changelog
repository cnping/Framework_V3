1. add nor and ddr testcase thread, but it doesn't do anything but send "pass"

2. change to cpp file and add videotester

3. parser hasn't been added to display contents what the board has(2015-01-04)

4. add parser, and adjust all kinds of testcase(except keytester) to DIR testcase(2015-01-05)

5. modify printf-level to display all kinds of information(open_success-db_msg, open_fail-db_warn, device_data-db_debug, other-db_verb)

6. close fifo's read-endian as long as receive fail signal('F') except for tftester(because it is removable)

7. add parser to display content according to dragonboard.cfg

8. add sleep(1) after read fifo in xxThreadRead(), set height of lcd_r/g/b changable, but video's height unchangable

9. xxThreadRead() do NOT exit except micThreadRead() and spkThreadRead() because mictester will exit soon

10. modify ConfigureParser(), for len of tester-name, such as [TF] = x, to read digit 'x', use other ways, so [name]    =   xyz can work well, testName = atoi(&x)

11. rename testSensor(video) to testVideo to avoid confuse with g-sensor(rename to testAcc)

12. copy testcase to / if they are keep in tf to avoid program stop when plug out the tf card, but dragonboard was in Tf, Tf card can NOT be detect

13. tfThreadRead() must sleep for a while, can NOT be 1s!!! here sleep 200ms, it must be the same with value in tftest.c, if not, a endian of fifo will wait the other endian, but read-endian can be shorter than write-endian

14. dragonboard may cash when startVideoTester() crash

15. wifi is not exist in A20, so detect it in ConfigureParser() by resolution, it works well now(2015-01-09), but it maybe a bug in the future 

16. when power on, firstly read /mnt/extsd/DragonBoard/dragonboard.cfg(in TF card) to display which testcase when TESTNAME = 1, but if the file maybe not exist, so start all the testcase by default; secondly copy all the testcase to / to avoid dragonboard stop when tf card is plugged out, then start this testcase; thirdly if testcase not exist in tf card, also start /system/bin/testcase. So look testcase in TF as first startup item to easy debug, look /system/bin/testcase the second backup startup item. So clever I was! haha!!!

17. set dragonboard as the last startup item of system, it won't print any information, but it will print if is started it by hand. So need use android debug tools

18. there's still another work to detect whether the back video is UVC or TVIN on A20 platform(2015-01-09)

19. solve the problem of detect UVC or TVIN by read node "/dev/video2"(UVC), now it can works in V3(by UVC) and A20(by UVC or TVIN) automaticly, it maybe the END of DragonBoard(2015-01-12)

20. rtctester send string with real time, dragonboard just read fifo and display, acctester hasn't do like this and I want leave it to the next version(2015-01-13)
------------------DragonBoard(V0.0.1) END--------------------
